# tic-tac-toe-bot

A small serverless, stateless Tic-Tac-Toe Discord bot, written for [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy/docs/).

Inspired by DjDeveloperr's [Minesweeper](https://github.com/DjDeveloperr/Minesweeper).

## Deploy

To deploy your own instance of the bot, navigate to [this link](https://dash.deno.com/new?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invakid404/tic-tac-toe-bot/master/main.ts&env=TOKEN,PUBLIC_KEY), fill in `PUBLIC_KEY` and `TOKEN` and then deploy! 

Then, get the deno.dev link for the project, and set it as the "Interactions Endpoint URL" for your application in Discord Developer Portal.

## TODO

- [x] Implement basic game
- [x] Implement proper bot opponent
